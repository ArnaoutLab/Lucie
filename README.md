# Lucie

A Python package that will automatically import un-importable datasets on the UCI ML repository, by using heuristics to figure out how each dataset is likely to be laid out. 

Preserves the UCIML API to the best of its ability. 

Succeeds on around 83% of datasets with valid download links, and includes manually cleaned datasets to allow all top 100 datasets to be imported.
